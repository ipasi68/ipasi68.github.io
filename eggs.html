      <h2 id="nutrient-rich">Eggs Are Nutrient-Dense and Rich in Choline, Protein, and Antioxidants</h2>
      <p>
        Eggs provide high-quality protein, all essential amino acids, key vitamins (A, B12, D, E), minerals (selenium, phosphorus), choline, lutein and zeaxanthin—nutrients crucial for eye health and overall vitality.

      <p>
        A meta-analysis of 23 prospective studies (1.4M+ participants) found that consuming more than 1 egg per day was not associated with higher cardiovascular disease risk and was linked to lower risk of coronary artery disease.

      <p>
        In a large cohort of adults aged 70+, those eating 1–6 eggs per week had a 29 % lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and 17 % lower all-cause mortality, compared to those who rarely ate eggs.

      <p>
        In healthy young subjects, daily intake of two hard‑boiled eggs enhanced endothelial function (FMD, baPWV) and positively affected gut microbiota, without raising markers of inflammation, lipids or oxidative stress.
